/**
 * @file auth1.guard.ts
 * @description Angular route guard that integrates with NgRx store for state-based authentication.
 * This guard leverages the Redux pattern through NgRx to determine route access by checking
 * authentication state from the centralized store. Currently implemented as a placeholder
 * with a default return value, designed to be extended with specific store selectors for
 * authentication state management.
 * @module Guard
